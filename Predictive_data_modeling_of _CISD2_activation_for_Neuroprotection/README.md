# CISD2-Activation-and-Neuroprotection-Computational-Analysis-
A full computational biology project investigating the CISD2 protein and its role in neuroprotection, with a focus on identifying small molecules that may activate CISD2 and counter mitochondrial and ER stress associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

**📌 Abstract**

This project uses computational modeling to explore how the **CISD2** protein helps protect neurons from damage seen in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. CISD2 controls key cellular systems, including mitochondrial health, oxidative stress balance, and endoplasmic-reticulum function. When CISD2 levels fall, these systems weaken, and neurons become more vulnerable.
To study how CISD2 works and how it might be supported, the project analyzed CISD2 gene variants, predicted structural effects of mutations, and generated **2D** and **3D** protein models. These models were used to screen small molecules that could bind to CISD2 and potentially enhance its protective activity.
Molecular docking identified **Liquiritigenin**, a natural flavonoid, as the strongest CISD2-binding candidate. It demonstrated stable interactions, favorable docking scores, and good predicted drug-likeness and absorption properties. Pathway analysis showed that CISD2 activation could help reduce mitochondrial stress, oxidative damage, calcium imbalance, and apoptosis, all central to neurodegeneration.
Together, these results highlight CISD2 as an important neuroprotective target and identify Liquiritigenin as a promising compound for future experimental validation.
