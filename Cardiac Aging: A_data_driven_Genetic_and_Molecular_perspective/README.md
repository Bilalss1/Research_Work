**📌 Abstract**

This study investigates how and why the heart ages by integrating genetic data, cellular mechanisms, and molecular pathways involved in age-related cardiac decline. **Cardiac aging** is driven by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, telomere shortening, chronic inflammation, and the progressive loss of cardiomyocyte regenerative ability. These changes make the heart more vulnerable to conditions such as **hypertension**, **arrhythmias**, **atherosclerosis**, and **heart failure**.
The research identifies several genes at the center of cardiac aging, including **CISD family genes** (CISD1, CISD2, CISD3), SIRT1/SIRT3, TERT, and p53. These genes regulate mitochondrial efficiency, redox balance, metabolic stability, and cell-cycle control. Their disruption accelerates senescence and weakens the heart’s stress-response capacity. 
At the cellular level, cardiac aging is amplified by cardiomyocyte senescence, endothelial dysfunction, fibroblast-driven fibrosis, and a chronic inflammatory state known as inflammaging. Senescent cells release **SASP factors**, which further damage heart tissue and drive fibrosis and oxidative stress. 
The study also highlights major **signaling pathways**, including mTOR, AMPK, FOXO, SIRT1/PGC-1α, Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, and NF-κB — that collectively determine whether heart cells repair themselves or continue to decline. Disruption in these pathways is what transforms normal aging into disease. 
Finally, the project outlines several intervention strategies that show real potential, including flavonoids that enhance mitochondrial performance, senolytic compounds that selectively remove senescent cells, senostatics that suppress **SASP**, **CRISPR-based** gene modulation, and lifestyle approaches such as exercise and metabolic optimization. 
Together, these findings present a clear, data-driven understanding of the biology behind cardiac aging and highlight promising targets for future therapies aimed at maintaining heart health across the lifespan.
