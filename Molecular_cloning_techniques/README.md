**📌 Project Summary**

This project focused on cloning the cel48 glycoside hydrolase gene, a member of Glycoside Hydrolase Family 48 involved in cellulose degradation. The workflow began with DNA preparation and quantification using NanoDrop spectrophotometry to confirm template quality for PCR. Gene-specific primers were used to amplify cel48, and amplification was validated using agarose gel electrophoresis.
The correct DNA fragment was excised and purified before being ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector via TA-cloning. Recombinant plasmids were introduced into E. coli TOP10 competent cells through transformation. Blue–white screening allowed identification of successful recombinants, with white colonies selected for further analysis. Plasmid minipreps were performed on these colonies to isolate the recombinant construct.
Sanger sequencing was used to verify insert identity. Alignment with the reference cel48 sequence confirmed insertion of the target gene but revealed multiple point mutations. These mutations reflect common challenges in PCR-based cloning workflows, including polymerase fidelity limitations, template contamination, and suboptimal reaction conditions.
Overall, the project captures the complete gene-cloning pipeline—from amplification and gel purification to ligation, transformation, and sequence validation—while highlighting quality control steps and typical sources of experimental variation encountered in molecular cloning.
