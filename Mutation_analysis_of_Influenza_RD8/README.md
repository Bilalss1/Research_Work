# Mutation_analysis_of_Influenza_RD8
Analysis of Influenza RD8 isolated from chicken eggs, including RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PCR, cloning, transformation, sequencing and BLAST comparison. Final sequencing showed no influenza inserts, so no RD8 mutations could be identified.

**📌 Summary**

This project examined whether the Influenza RD8 strain carried genetic mutations that could influence viral behavior or vaccine relevance. Amniotic fluid from infected chicken eggs was collected, and viral RNA was extracted using a silica-column method. Nanodrop readings confirmed RNA recovery but also revealed contamination, which can interfere with enzyme activity and downstream PCR.
Extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using influenza-specific primers, oligo(dT) primers, and random hexamers. The cDNA was used to amplify the influenza HA and NA genes through PCR, but the reactions produced primer dimers rather than the expected gene bands. This indicated amplification failure, likely caused by impurities or low viral RNA levels.
Despite the failed PCR, the workflow continued. The reaction products were cloned into a PCR 2.1 vector and transformed into E. coli. Transformation was successful, supported by a high number of white colonies and an efficiency of 1 × 10⁸ cfu/ng. However, plasmid digestion patterns did not show the expected inserts.
Sequencing confirmed the issue: NA sequences matched Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, while HA sequences matched a cloning vector—not influenza. BLAST analysis showed no alignment with influenza A, meaning no influenza genetic material was present in the final clones.

**Bottom line:** The workflow ran successfully, but the viral genes never amplified or entered the vector. As a result, no RD8 mutations could be identified.
